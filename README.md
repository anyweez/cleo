Cleo
====

Cleo is an adventure into using Go for basic distributed systems tasks.
The goal of Cleo is to index and make large sets of League of Legends
gameplay information accessible for analysis. It currently utilizes Riot's
API to download a stream of game outcome data, builds an index of this
information, and runs a very simple query engine that can answer questions
of the form: 

	"How many games has <champion combination X> won against <champion combination Y>?

It utilizes Google's protocol buffer library for some serialization tasks
and uses MongoDB as a backend for storing extracted game data.

Basic architecture
====================
FETCHER: retrieving the data
Fetcher is a daemon that regularly accesses Riot's game history API to
retrieve information for known summoners. It starts off with a seed set
of summoners and updates its list as it discovers new summoners in new
games.

When fetcher receives game information it writes it parses it into an
internal data format and stores the parsed version in a MongoDB instance.

PACKER: building the index
Packer reads the MongoDB instance and reformats + filters the games into
an effecient data structure that Lolstat can use for searching.

LOLSTAT: searching
Lolstat reads in the index generated by the packer and opens up a network
connection to await queries. When queries come in it performs searches
on the index, computes key statistics, and returns them in a query response.
